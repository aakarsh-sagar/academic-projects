These are some of the Projects I worked on for my courses in my Master's program in Data Science at the University of Denver.


1. **T-20 Cricket Analytics**: A Python and Tableau project that uses cricket analytics to build a tournament-winning team with the right mix of batters, bowlers, and wicketkeepers.
                           Cricket analytics is essential in the modern game, helping teams make data-driven decisions to improve performance and win matches.
                           Statistical analysis and data visualizations to analyze player performance and select the best team composition.

                           Web Scraping Tool: MS Power Automate
                           Programming language used for data cleaning, and wrangling: Python
                           Data Visualization Tool: Tableau --> https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aakarsh.sagar/viz/IPLAnalytics_16854181898210/Batsman

2. **Product Recommendation**: A project that explores the concept of analyzing user data and behaviors to provide personalized suggestions for products or services.
                           For small businesses, product recommendation systems can be particularly beneficial. 
                           Firstly, they enable small businesses to compete with larger enterprises by delivering tailored suggestions to customers, creating a more personalized shopping experience. This increases customer satisfaction and loyalty, leading to repeat purchases and positive word-of-mouth.
                           Furthermore, product recommendation systems contribute to revenue growth through upselling and cross-selling. By suggesting complementary or higher-priced items based on user preferences or previous purchases, businesses can encourage customers to spend more. This strategy effectively maximizes the value of each transaction and boosts overall revenue.
                           Additionally, these systems allow small businesses to make data-driven decisions by gathering insights into customer preferences and market trends. This information can be used to optimize product offerings, marketing strategies, and inventory management, leading to improved operational efficiency and profitability.

**Conclusion**: 
                          ● Performed exploratory data analysis, visualizing top-selling products and identifying seasonal order and revenue trends.
                          ● Analyzed customer behavior, highlighting the importance of a customer retention strategy due to a majority of one-time purchasers.
                          ● Utilized cosine similarity for personalized recommendations, enhancing the relevance and diversity of suggested items based on user and item similarity.

4. **Credit Card Fraud Detection using XGBoost**: 
                          ●	Developed a machine learning model using XGBoost Algorithm to predict fraudulent transactions on an imbalanced dataset with an accuracy of 99.96%.
                          ●	Optimized model performance by tuning hyper-parameters using cross-validation techniques.
                          ●	Evaluated the model performance using key metrics such as precision-recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
